    # Summary

    This document contains version 3.0 of the Icelandic Online Banking Services (IOBWS), for currencies, released 
    as a technical specification (TS) no. 312 by the Icelandic Standards Council. Previous versions of IOBWS, released
    in 2007 and 2013 respectively, each used the then most recent OASIS SOAP standards to establish common banking
    interfaces for the Icelandic market. The aim in v3.0 is to offer a more interoperable set of 
    Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to provide open access to data.

        This preference might be ignored by the Bank, if a signing basket is not supported as functionality.

        If it equals "false" or if the parameter is not used, there is no preference of the TPP.
        This especially indicates that the TPP assumes a direct authorisation of the transaction in the next step,
        without using a signing basket.

        providing an integrated confirmation of funds request an the result of this is that not sufficient
        funds are available.

        If it equals "false" then the TPP prefers that the Bank is dealing with the payment initiation like
        in the Banks online channel, potentially waiting for a certain time period for funds to arrive to initiate the payment.

        This parameter might be ignored by the Bank.

        For security reasons, it shall be ensured that the TPP-Notification-URI as introduced above is secured by the TPP eIDAS QWAC used for identification of the TPP. The following applies:

        URIs which are provided by TPPs in TPP-Notification-URI shall comply with the domain secured by the eIDAS QWAC certificate of the TPP in the field CN or SubjectAltName of the certificate. Please note that in case of example-TPP.com as certificate entry TPP- Notification-URI like www.example-TPP.com/xs2a-client/v1/Bankidentifcation/mytransaction- id/notifications or notifications.example-TPP.com/xs2a-client/v1/Bankidentifcation/mytransaction- id/notifications would be compliant.

        Wildcard definitions shall be taken into account for compliance checks by the Bank.

        The usage of the constants supports the of following semantics:

          SCA: A notification on every change of the scaStatus attribute for all related authorisation processes is preferred by the TPP.

          PROCESS: A notification on all changes of consentStatus or transactionStatus attributes is preferred by the TPP.
          LAST: Only a notification on the last consentStatus or transactionStatus as available in the XS2A interface is preferred by the TPP.
