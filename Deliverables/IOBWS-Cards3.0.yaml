    # Summary

    This document contains version 3.0 of the Icelandic Online Banking Services (IOBWS), for currencies, released 
    as a technical specification (TS) no. 311 by the Icelandic Standards Council. Previous versions of IOBWS, released
    in 2007 and 2013 respectively, each used the then most recent OASIS SOAP standards to establish common banking
    interfaces for the Icelandic market. They specified strict security requirements involving a combination of 
    WS-Security X.509 Binary Security and Username tokens, making implementations on some platforms and frameworks
    cumbersome, especially when third party service providers are involved. In the meantime new technology standards
    have emerged and Europe been catching up to Iceland. The aim in v3.0 is to therefore to offer a modern, open, 
    and interoperable set of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to provide data securely.

        The following balance types are defined:
          - "closingBooked": 
            Balance of the account at the end of the pre-agreed account reporting period. 
            It is the sum of the opening booked balance at the beginning of the period and all entries booked 
            to the account during the pre-agreed account reporting period.
            
            For card-accounts, this is composed of
            
              - invoiced, but not yet paid entries
            
          - "expected":
            Balance composed of booked entries and pending items known at the time of calculation, 
            which projects the end of day balance if everything is booked on the account and no other entry is posted.
            
            For card accounts, this is composed of:
              - invoiced, but not yet paid entries
              - not yet invoiced but already booked entries and
              - pending items (not yet booked)
            
            For card-accounts:
            
            "money to spend with the value of a pre-approved credit limit on the card account"
            
          - "openingBooked":
            Book balance of the account at the beginning of the account reporting period. 
            It always equals the closing book balance from the previous report.
          - "interimAvailable":
            Available balance calculated in the course of the account ?servicer?s business day, 
            at the time specified, and subject to further changes during the business day. 
            The interim balance is calculated on the basis of booked credit and debit items during the calculation 
            time/period specified.
            
            For card-accounts, this is composed of:
              - invoiced, but not yet paid entries
              - not yet invoiced but already booked entries
          - "interimBooked":

            and subject to further changes during the business day. 
            The interim balance is calculated on the basis of booked credit and debit items during the calculation time/period 
            specified.
          - "forwardAvailable":
            Forward available balance of money that is at the disposal of the account owner on the date specified.

        If it equals "false" or if the parameter is not used, there is no preference of the TPP.
        This especially indicates that the TPP assumes a direct authorisation of the transaction in the next step,

        providing an integrated confirmation of funds request an the result of this is that not sufficient
        funds are available.

        If it equals "false" then the TPP prefers that the ASPSP is dealing with the payment initiation like
        in the ASPSPs online channel, potentially waiting for a certain time period for funds to arrive to initiate the payment.

        This parameter might be ignored by the ASPSP.

        For security reasons, it shall be ensured that the TPP-Notification-URI as introduced above is secured by the TPP eIDAS QWAC used for identification of the TPP. The following applies:

        URIs which are provided by TPPs in TPP-Notification-URI shall comply with the domain secured by the eIDAS QWAC certificate of the TPP in the field CN or SubjectAltName of the certificate. Please note that in case of example-TPP.com as certificate entry TPP- Notification-URI like www.example-TPP.com/xs2a-client/v1/ASPSPidentifcation/mytransaction- id/notifications or notifications.example-TPP.com/xs2a-client/v1/ASPSPidentifcation/mytransaction- id/notifications would be compliant.

        Wildcard definitions shall be taken into account for compliance checks by the ASPSP.
         ASPSPs may respond with ASPSP-Notification-Support set to false, if the provided URIs do not comply.

        The usage of the constants supports the of following semantics:

          SCA: A notification on every change of the scaStatus attribute for all related authorisation processes is preferred by the TPP.

          PROCESS: A notification on all changes of consentStatus or transactionStatus attributes is preferred by the TPP.
          LAST: Only a notification on the last consentStatus or transactionStatus as available in the XS2A interface is preferred by the TPP.
