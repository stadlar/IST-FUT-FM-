    # Summary

    This document contains version 3.0 of the Icelandic Online Banking Services (IOBWS), for currencies, released 
    as a technical specification (TS) no. 311 by the Icelandic Standards Council. Previous versions of IOBWS, released
    in 2007 and 2013 respectively, each used the then most recent OASIS SOAP standards to establish common banking
    interfaces for the Icelandic market. The aim in v3.0 is to offer a more modern and interoperable set of 
    Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to provide card data not previously exposed.

            Balance composed of booked entries and pending items known at the time of calculation, 
            which projects the end of day balance if everything is booked on the account and no other entry is posted.
            
            For card accounts, this is composed of:
              - invoiced, but not yet paid entries

          - "openingBooked":
            Book balance of the account at the beginning of the account reporting period. 
            It always equals the closing book balance from the previous report.
          - "interimAvailable":
            Available balance calculated in the course of the account ?servicer?s business day, 
            at the time specified, and subject to further changes during the business day.

        If it equals "false" or if the parameter is not used, there is no preference of the TPP.
        This especially indicates that the TPP assumes a direct authorisation of the transaction in the next step,
        without using a signing basket.

        providing an integrated confirmation of funds request an the result of this is that not sufficient
        funds are available.

        If it equals "false" then the TPP prefers that the Bank is dealing with the payment initiation like
        in the ASPSPs online channel, potentially waiting for a certain time period for funds to arrive to initiate the payment.

        This parameter might be ignored by the Bank.

        Wildcard definitions shall be taken into account for compliance checks by the Bank.

        repeated.
        The usage of the constants supports the of following semantics:

          SCA: A notification on every change of the scaStatus attribute for all related authorisation processes is preferred by the TPP.

          PROCESS: A notification on all changes of consentStatus or transactionStatus attributes is preferred by the TPP.
          LAST: Only a notification on the last consentStatus or transactionStatus as available in the XS2A interface is preferred by the TPP.

        This header field may be ignored, if the Bank does not support resource notification services for the related TPP.
