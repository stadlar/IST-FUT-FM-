funding_paragraph: |
  The work on the ÍST TS was primarily funded by Arion Banki, Íslandsbanki and Landsbankinn. It is the result of the workgroup TN-FMÞ-VH-8. In part, the work is based on the earlier technical specification TS-314 authored by TN-FMÞ-VH-2 on Technical Requirements, and TN-FMÞ-VH-1 on Business Requirements, with the participation of an external consultant. 
  TS-314 was approved within TN-FMÞ on 13.9.2021.
  TS-314 is the next version of the Icelandic Online Banking Services, replacing TS 165:2013 *Rafræn skjöl*.
