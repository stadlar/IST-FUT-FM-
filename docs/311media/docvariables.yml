funding_paragraph: |
  The work on the ÍST TS was primarily funded by Arion Banki, Íslandsbanki and Landsbankinn. It is the result of the workgroup TN-FMÞ-VH-8. In part, the work is based on the earlier technical specification TS-311 authored by TN-FMÞ-VH-2 on Technical Requirements, and TN-FMÞ-VH-1 on Business Requirements, with the participation of an external consultant. 
  TS-311 was approved within TN-FMÞ on 15.3.2021.
  TS-311 adds new products to the Icelandic Online Banking Services, though it indirectly expands on TS 164:2013 *Yfirlit bankareikninga*.
