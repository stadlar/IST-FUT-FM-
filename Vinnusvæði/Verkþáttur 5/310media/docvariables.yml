funding_paragraph: |
  The work on the ÍST TS was primarily funded by Íslandsbanki, Arion Banki and Landsbankinn. 
  It is the result the workgroup TN-FMÞ-VH-8. In parts the work is the earlier workshop agreement 
  WA-310 authored by TN-FMÞ-VH-1 on Technical requirements and TN-FMÞ-VH-2 on Business requirements, 
  with participation of an external consultant. WA-310 was approved within TN-FMÞ on the 2019-12-12. 
  ÍST TS-310 should, however, not be viewed as a direct succesor to that agreement, 
  which focused on laying groundwork for PSD2 compliance. Instead TS-310 is the next version of the Icelandic Online Banking Services, replacing TS 161:2013 *Greiðslur* and TS 164:2013 *Yfirlit bankareikninga*.
