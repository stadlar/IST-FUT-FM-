  version: "3.0"
  description: |
    The claim service is focused on two parties. First is the company (claimant) who creates claims and then
    the collection company.  

    The Claims Service enables creditors to create, modify and cancel claims. A creditor can also revive canceled
    claims, send claims to an intermediate debt collector and obtain a list of claims according to the given search
    criteria, and thus get a good overview of all their claims.

    The Collection Service uses the same endpoints as the claimant endpoints. There is a restriction on the 
    collection company, it's not allowed to create claims. The claim service enables dept collectors to work 
    with the claims under their care. The service is mostly as structured as the service for claims, except 
    that it is not possible to create collection claims
